Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.\n",

    "- Any relevant data sets should be available under the **Data** module on Canvas. To make life easier on the graders if they need to run your code, do not change the relative path names here. Instead, move the files around on your computer.\n",
    "- If you're not familiar with typesetting math directly into Markdown then by all means, do your work on paper first and then typeset it later.  Remember that there is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code. \n",
    "- This probably goes without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work and justify your answers to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit. \n",

Though I've annotated in detailed how the code works, I'll explain it again. First step is to make the dictionary, holding all the nodes of the graph and their respective connections. So for instance, I add node $R$ for Reservoir as the key, then give it values $G$ for Gym, and $E$ for Engineeing, both of which are connected to it. After that, I make a function called tracker which essentually iterates over a series of potential paths from the start node to some finish node, which I detailed thoroughly in my function test variable called partA_Sim. I passed it Oscar's beginning, $E$, for Engineering, the number of steps it should take him to arrive, and then the final destination, $L$, the Library. I then sum that over 200,000 trials, and divide to find the mean probability. And it works out with the answer I got. $\\checkmark$"
